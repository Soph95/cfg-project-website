        <h4>Recommendations</h4>
        <p>"The Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World" was a gift of friendship from
            the people of France to the United States and is recognized as a universal
            symbol of freedom and democracy and was dedicated on
            October 28, 1886. It was designated as a National Monument in 1924. Visiting
            Liberty Island is one of the most rewarding experiences of any trip to
            New York City. However, visitors who wish to enter the pedestal or crown must
            secure reservations in advanced. Reservations secured far enough in advance allow visitors to select their desired level of access, and also eliminates the need to wait in line to purchase tickets. Crown tickets are available by advanced reservation only.</p>
